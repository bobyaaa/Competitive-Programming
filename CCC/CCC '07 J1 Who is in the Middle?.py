#One of my earliest submissions when I was just starting to program ^^

one = input()
two = input()
three = input()

if one > two and one < three:
  print one
elif one > three and one < two:
  print one
elif two > one and two < three: 
  print two
elif two > three and two < one:
  print two
elif three > one and three < two:
  print three
elif three > two and three < one:
  print three
