//This is a 2D coordinate grid problem, my method of solving it was using a difference array.
//You cannot brute force this problem and plot and fill each point inside the radius of wifi with the bitrate.
//Instead, just plot two points, (positive) bitrate and (negative) bitrate, per each row that's in the coffeeshop's wireless range (y-value)
//and then run your grid through a prefix sum array and voila.
//after you're done plotting all the points. Then find the max, and find the frequency of the max.

//The tricky/annoying part of this question is the grid itself and finding the relationship between the
//x and y value that is given to the ones that correspond to your own array.
//May be a bit slow to do it in python

//If you're having trouble understanding this explanation, print the city_grid after every big chunk of code.
